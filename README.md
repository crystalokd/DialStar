# DialStar

Welcome to the readme file for DialStar mobile app that I are developing with React Native and React Native community/netinfo. The primary purpose of this app is to help users set a limit on their cellular data consumption and get a notification when the limit is reached.

Currently, the app is still under development, as I are facing a challenge in accessing the specific information on data consumption from network providers. However, I are working to find alternative solutions and make the app as useful as possible for users.

Once completed, this app will be beneficial to those who want to track their data usage and avoid overages. By setting a limit, users can stay in control of their cellular data usage and avoid unexpected bills.

In addition to the data limit feature, we plan to include other helpful functionalities, such as the ability to track usage over time and view usage statistics.
